This repository features a pull request I made to an application belonging to Underdog Developers non-profit. The goal of the application was to connect mentors with people coming from lower socio-economic backgrounds, and also people who were formerly incarcerated. The pull request introduced a new method of natural language processing for topic modeling, called non-negative matrix factorization. Contained is a function which determines topics by their vectorized significance.
