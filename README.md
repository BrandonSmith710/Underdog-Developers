This repository features a pull request I made to an application belonging to Underdog Developers non-profit. The pull request introduced a new method of natural language processing for topic modeling, called non-negative matrix factorization. Contained is a function which determines topics by their vectorized significance. The file added was NMF_Topic_Model.ipynb, in the notebooks directory.
